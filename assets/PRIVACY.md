Ako Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-08-08

Overview
Ako is designed to be privacy-first. It keeps your data on your device and does not collect personal information.

What the extension collects
The extension does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal information. It makes no network requests, does not track browsing activity, and uses no analytics.

Data stored on your device
The key–value items you create in the popup, along with minimal metadata (an internal id, creation time, and list order), are saved locally using chrome.storage.local under the key "akoItems". This data never leaves your device unless you choose to export or share it.

How your data is used
Your local data is used only to support the core functions of the extension: adding, editing, reordering, copying, and deleting items.

Permissions
The extension requests only the "storage" permission to save your items locally. It does not request host permissions and does not access or modify website content.

Third parties
The extension does not share data with third parties. There are no ads, trackers, or analytics.

Children’s privacy
The extension is a general-purpose utility and is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

User control
You can delete individual items or clear all items (with confirmation) at any time. You can also hide or reveal values in the UI for on-screen privacy.

Changes to this policy
If this policy changes, we will update the effective date above and publish the updated policy with the extension.
